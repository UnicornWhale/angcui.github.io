    <td><p>Francis Lee is a bioengineer working in mammalian synthetic biology.  He is interested in the science and future of growing organisms.  Francis received his undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from UIUC and a MSc in Biological Engineering from MIT.  He was part of the early team at Ginkgo Bioworks as a Build Engineer, Opentrons as a software engineer, and he currently works in the Synthetic Biology Center at MIT. </p></td>

    <td><p>Marc-Jospeh Antonini is a Ph.D. student in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics at Harvard/MIT Health Sciences and Technology department. After earning a Mechanical and Industrial Engineering degree from Arts & Metiers ParisTech, Marc-Joseph pursued a M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering at the Imperial College London, where he developed a low cost 3d printed prosthetic hand. He then spent a year in the Graybiel lab at MIT studying the influence of striatal interneurons on neural oscillation and the neuronal dysfunction in a new animal my model of Huntington's Disease. During his Ph.D. he would like to use bioinspired approaches to develop tools to record, control and model neuronal dynamics.</p></td>

While an engineer-scientist 1965-78, Bob Metcalfe was an Internet pioneer, inventing Ethernet at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1973. Today, over a billion new wired and wireless (WiFi) Ethernet ports are shipped annually. While an entrepreneur-executive 1979-90, Bob grew 3Com Corporation, the billion-dollar networking company. 3Com went public in 1984, did $5.7 billion in sales during 1999, and joined HP in 2010.</p></td>
